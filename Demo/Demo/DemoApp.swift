import SwiftUI

/// This is the main demo app.
///
/// This app contains two keyboard extensions, that can both
/// be enabled from System Settings. Full Access is required
/// for certain features, like haptic feedback.
///
/// `IMPORTANT` Although this app lets you test the keyboard
/// and language settings screens, as well as dictation, the
/// app does NOT sync settings between the app and keyboards.
/// This requires an App Group, which requires the app to be
/// code signed. This is why these keyboards must have their
/// own settings, which is otherwise not needed. Furthermore,
/// while the Pro keyboard *can* open this demo app to start
/// dictation, and the demo app *can* perform dictation then
/// return to *some* apps, the dictated text isn't available
/// to the keyboard since no App Group can be created.
