/// settings type. Use ``setupStore(_:keyPrefix:)`` to setup
/// a custom store, or ``setupStore(withAppGroup:keyPrefix:)``
/// to setup a store that syncs data between the app and its
/// keyboard extension, using an App Group.
///
/// You can also provide a custom ``storeKeyPrefix`` that is
/// added before each persisted value. The default prefix is
/// `"com.keyboardkit.settings."`.
///
/// > Important: `@AppStorage` properties will use the store
/// that's available when a property is first accessed. Make
/// sure to run ``setupStore(_:keyPrefix:)`` BEFORE your app
/// or keyboard extension accesses these settings properties.
