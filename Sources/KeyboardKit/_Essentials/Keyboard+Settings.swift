    /// This lets us decouple the input view controller from

    /// Do not confuse this with ``KeyboardSettings``, which
    /// is an observable class for general keyboard settings
    /// that you can access via ``keyboardSettings``.
    ///
    /// Unlike the ``Keyboard/State`` properties, these will
    /// persist any changes that are made to them. Make sure

    /// articles for more information on how to sync changes
    /// between the main app and the keyboard extension.
    ///
    /// KeyboardKit will automatically sync applied settings
    /// with ``KeyboardInputViewController/state`` when your
    /// keyboard launches, and will add `onChange` events to
    /// the keyboard view to apply settings changes to these
    /// state instances as well. Context changes are however
    /// not synced to settings.
