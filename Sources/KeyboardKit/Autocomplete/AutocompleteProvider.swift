/// This protocol can be implemented by any classes that can
/// return autocomplete suggestions as the user types.
///
/// Simply call ``autocompleteSuggestions(for:)`` to perform
/// an autocomplete operation that returns suggestions for a
/// certain text in the current ``locale``. 
///
/// Once you have a list of suggestions, you can use them to
/// perform ``nextCharacterPredictions(forText:suggestions:)``
/// that returns a dictionary with character keys and values
/// that represent the probability that the character is the
/// next character the user will type.
///
/// Words can be learned using ``learnWord(_:)`` and ignored
/// with ``ignoreWord(_:)``. Learned words are persisted and
/// will be considered in any subsequent calculations, while
/// ignored words are just ignored by this provider instance.
///
/// Not all autocomplete providers support ignoring/learning
/// words. Check ``canLearnWords`` and ``canIgnoreWords`` to
/// check whether a provider supports it. Also note that the
/// provider may support it while not being able to return a
/// list of ``ignoredWords`` and ``learnedWords``.
///
/// KeyboardKit does not have a standard provider, as it has
/// for other services. Instead, a disabled provider will be
/// used until you register a custom provider, or register a
/// valid KeyboardKit Pro license key.

/// See <doc:Autocomplete-Article> for more information.
