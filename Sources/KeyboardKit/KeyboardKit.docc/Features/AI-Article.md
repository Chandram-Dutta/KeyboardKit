Apple's native keyboard APIs lack many features that are needed to build AI-based features, for instance to read an entire document to perform tasks like spellchecking & proofreading, or to let users type text within the keyboard itself.

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks these capabilities to make it possible to read the full document and type in a text field within the keyboard.


## Full Document Reader

Apple's native text document proxy doesn't return all the text within the document. It instead cuts off the available text at any time, e.g. at the previous or next paragraph. This makes it hard to provide AI-based features that require more context.

KeyboardKit Pro therefore unlocks ``UIKit/UITextDocumentProxy/fullDocumentContext(config:)`` proxy extensions that let you read **all** text from the proxy:

```swift
let proxy = keyboardContext.textDocumentProxy
let result = try await proxy.fullDocumentContext()
```

This will provide you with all the text before and after the input cursor, as well as an aggregate of all the available text in the document. 

See the <doc:Proxy-Article> article for more information.


## Next Word Prediction

Apple's native text prediction utilities stopped supporting next word prediction in iOS 16. It instead only provides predictions on already typed text, without any (known) way to get next word predictions. 

KeyboardKit Pro therefore unlocks ways to perform next word prediction via 3rd party AI services. The easiest way to enable next word prediction, is to add a Claude- or OpenAI-based ``Autocomplete/NextWordPredictionRequest`` to your ``KeyboardApp``:

```swift
extension KeyboardApp {

    static var keyboardKitDemo: KeyboardApp {
        KeyboardApp(
            ...
            autocomplete: .init(
                nextWordPredictionRequest: .claude(apiKey: "your-key-here")
            )
        )
    }
}
```

Users can then enable ``AutocompleteSettings/isNextWordPredictionEnabled`` to allow the ``Autocomplete/LocalAutocompleteService`` to perform predictions.

See the <doc:Autocomplete-Article> article for more information and important considerations.


## Text Input

Apple's native input controller & text document proxy don't let you type in text fields within the keyboard. Instead, text will be sent to the main app even if a text field in the keyboard is focused. This makes it hard to let user perform AI-based prompting within the keyboard.

KeyboardKit Pro therefore unlocks ways to let users type within a keyboard extension, without needing you to write any additional code:

```swift
extension MyView: View {

    @EnvironmentObject var context: KeyboardContext

    @State var text = ""

    var body: some View {
        KeyboardTextField(
            text: $text, 
            keyboardContext: context
        )
    }
}
```

The keyboard-specific text components will automatically manage text routing and only take proxy ownership while they are focused.
