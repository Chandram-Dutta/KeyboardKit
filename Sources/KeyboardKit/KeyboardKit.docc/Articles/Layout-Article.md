A flexible keyboard layout is an important part of a software keyboard, and must consider many factors like the current locale, device, screen orientation, user preferences, etc.

In KeyboardKit, an ``InputSet`` defines the input keys of a keyboard, after which a ``KeyboardLayoutService`` can create a dynamic ``KeyboardLayout`` at runtime that defines the full set of keys. 

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks localized layout services for all ``Foundation/Locale/keyboardKitSupported`` locales in your license, additional input sets like ``InputSet/qwertz`` & ``InputSet/azerty``, iPad Pro support, more layout capabilities that make modifying layouts easier, etc. Read more further down.



## Namespace

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardLayout`` type that is also a namespace for other layout-related types like ``KeyboardLayout/Configuration``, ``KeyboardLayout/Item``, etc.



## Input Sets & Layouts

In KeyboardKit an ``InputSet`` specifies the input keys of a keyboard, while a ``KeyboardLayout`` specifies the full set of keys. Layouts can vary greatly for different devices, screens, locales, etc.

KeyboardKit comes with pre-defined input sets, like ``InputSet/qwerty``, ``InputSet/numeric(currency:)`` & ``InputSet/symbolic(currencies:)``. KeyboardKit Pro unlocks more input sets, like ``InputSet/qwertz`` and ``InputSet/azerty``, as well as locale-specific input sets for all ``Foundation/Locale/keyboardKitSupported`` locales.

While most iOS keyboards have 3 input rows of input keys surrounded by action keys, and a bottom row with space bar and action keys, this is not true for all locales. The layout can vary greatly, so the layout engine must be flexible.



## Services

In KeyboardKit, a ``KeyboardLayoutService`` can generate dynamic layouts at runtime, It provides us with the flexibility we need, to accomodate to the varying needs for different locales, devices, etc.

KeyboardKit injects ``KeyboardLayout/StandardLayoutService`` into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``. You can replace it at any time, as described further down, or add custom services to it with ``KeyboardLayoutService/tryRegisterLocalizedService(_:)``.

## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks more input sets, like ``InputSet/qwertz`` & ``InputSet/azerty``, as well as alphabetic, numeric & symbolic sets for all ``Foundation/Locale/keyboardKitSupported`` locales that are included in your license, like `.swedishNumeric`.

KeyboardKit Pro also unlocks a localized ``KeyboardLayout/ProLayoutService`` for every locale in your license and injects them as localized services into the main ``Keyboard/Services/layoutService`` when a valid license is registered. You can access any localized service in your license like this:

```swift
let service = try KeyboardLayout.ProLayoutService.Swedish()
```


### iPad Pro Support

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks an ``KeyboardLayout/iPadProLayoutService`` that can generate iPad Pro-specific layouts for most supported locales.


### Pro Layout Capabilites

KeyboardKit Pro extends the ``KeyboardLayout`` ``KeyboardLayout/itemRows-swift.property`` property and all layout ``KeyboardLayout/Item`` collections with more capabilities, that make it easier to insert, remove, and replace items and actions.

KeyboardKit Pro also unlocks more ``KeyboardLayout`` capabilities like ``KeyboardLayout/adjusted(for:layoutConfiguration:)``, ``KeyboardLayout/copy()`` and ``KeyboardLayout/createIdealItem(for:width:alignment:)``, and a specific set of tools for the bottom row, like ``KeyboardLayout/bottomRowLayout``.

See ``KeyboardLayout`` and its ``KeyboardLayout/Item`` in the KeyboardKit Pro documentations for a full list of capabilities that KeyboardKit Pro unlocks. The open-source documentation doesn't include all these extensions, which is why they are not in the documentation.

## How to...

### Create a custom layout service

You can create a custom ``KeyboardLayoutService`` to customize the layout for a certain locale, or define a fully custom layout.

You can implement the ``KeyboardLayoutService`` protocol from scratch, or inherit and customize ``KeyboardLayout/StandardLayoutService`` or the ``KeyboardLayout/BaseLayoutService``, ``KeyboardLayout/iPadLayoutService``, ``KeyboardLayout/iPadProLayoutService``, or ``KeyboardLayout/iPhoneLayoutService`` base classes:

```swift
class CustomKeyboardLayoutService: KeyboardLayout.StandardLayoutService {
    
    // Never use array indices if it can cause a crash.
    override func keyboardLayout(for context: KeyboardContext) -> KeyboardLayout {
        var layout = super.keyboardLayout(for: context)
        // Perform any modifications here
        return layout
    }
}
```

To use your custom service instead of the standard one, just inject it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` by replacing its ``Keyboard/Services/layoutService`` property:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        services.layoutService = CustomKeyboardLayoutService()
    }
}
```

This will make KeyboardKit use your custom implementation instead of the standard one.



### Customize a localized Pro service

Service that inherit ``KeyboardLayout/StandardLayoutService`` can use ``KeyboardLayoutService/tryRegisterLocalizedService(_:)`` or the ``Keyboard/Services`` convenient ``Keyboard/Services/tryRegisterLocalizedLayoutService(_:)`` function to register a custom service for a certain locale.

For instance, this is how you could make KeyboardKit Pro use a custom service for ``Foundation/Locale/german``:

```swift
class MyCustomGermanService: KeyboardLayout.ProLayoutService.German { ... } 

class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        services.tryRegisterLocalizedLayoutService(
            try! MyCustomGermanService() 
        )
    }
}
```

This makes it easy to replace layout service for a certain locale, since you can inherit and customize the related ``KeyboardLayout/ProLayoutService``.
