Apple's native keyboard APIs lack many features that are needed by popular AI-based features, for instance to read an entire document to perform tasks like spellchecking & proofreading, or to let users type text prompts directly within the keyboard.

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks these capabilities to make it possible to read the full document and type in a text field within the keyboard.


## Full Document Reader

Apple's native text document proxy doesn't return all the text within the document. It instead cuts off the available text at any time, e.g. at the previous or next paragraph. This makes it hard to provide AI-based features that require more context.

KeyboardKit Pro therefore unlocks ways to read **all** text from the proxy, using ``UIKit/UITextDocumentProxy/fullDocumentContext(config:)`` proxy extensions that reads the full document content by moving the input cursor in intricate ways.

```swift
let proxy = keyboardContext.textDocumentProxy
let result = try await proxy.fullDocumentContext()
```

This will provide you with all the text before and after the text input cursor, as well as an aggregate of all the available text. See the <doc:Proxy-Article> article for more information.


## Next Word Prediction (BETA)

Apple's native text prediction utilities stopped supporting next word prediction in iOS 16, which means that we can only complete and correct words that we have started typing.

KeyboardKit Pro therefore unlocks ways to inject 3rd party support for performing next word prediction, by specifying a ``Autocomplete/NextWordPredictionRequest``in your ``KeyboardApp``'s ``KeyboardApp/autocompleteConfiguration-swift.property``:

```swift
extension KeyboardApp {

    static var keyboardKitDemo: Self {
        .init(
            ...
            autocompleteConfiguration: .init(
                nextWordPredictionRequest: .claude(apiKey: ...)
            )
        )
    }
}
```

This will automatically inject the request into the autocomplete service when your license is registered. Use ``AutocompleteContext`` ``AutocompleteContext/Settings-swift.struct/isNextWordPredictionEnabled`` to disable this feature. See the <doc:Autocomplete-Article> article for more information.

> Warning: AI-based next word prediction requires Full Access for the keyboard to communicate with the remote service, and will send the user's text to that remote service. Make sure to explicitly get the users consent before activating this feature.


## Text Input Support

Apple's native input controller & text document proxy don't let you type in text fields within the keyboard. Instead, text will be sent to the main app even if a text field in the keyboard is focused. This makes it hard to let user perform AI-based prompting within the keyboard.

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks ways to let users type within a keyboard extension, by routing text input from the main app to text fields within the keyboard, without the need for any additional code.

```swift
extension MyView: View {

    @EnvironmentObject var context: KeyboardContext

    @State var text = ""

    var body: some View {
        KeyboardTextField(
            text: $text, 
            keyboardContext: context
        )
    }
}
```
