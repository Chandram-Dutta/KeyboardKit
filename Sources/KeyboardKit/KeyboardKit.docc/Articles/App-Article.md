KeyboardKit provides many utilities for the main app target, that simplifies building a great keyboard app.

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks app views for the main app target. Information about Pro features can be found at the end of this article.



## Keyboard App Namespace

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardApp`` struct that is also a namespace for app-related types and views, like the ``KeyboardApp/HomeScreen``, ``KeyboardApp/SettingsScreen`` and ``KeyboardApp/LocaleScreen`` views that are unlocked with KeyboardKit Pro.



## Keyboard App

The ``KeyboardApp`` type can be used to define important app properties, such as ``KeyboardApp/name``, ``KeyboardApp/licenseKey`` (for KeyboardKit Pro), ``KeyboardApp/bundleId`` (for keyboard status inspection), ``KeyboardApp/appGroupId`` (sync data between the app and keyboard), deep links, etc.

You can create a static app value and add it to both the main app target and its keyboard extension target, to easily refer to it from both:

```swift
static var keyboardKitDemo: Self {
    .init(
        name: "KeyboardKit",
        licenseKey: "abc123",
        bundleId: "com.keyboardkit.demo",
        appGroupId: "group.com.keyboardkit.demo",
        locales: [.english, .swedish, .persian],
        dictationDeepLink: "keyboardkit://dictation"
    )
}
```

The app value can also resolve other properties that you may need, such as a ``dictationConfiguration``.

> Important: The ``KeyboardApp/locales`` collection is only meant to describe which locales you *want* to use in your app and keyboard. It will be capped to the number of locales that your KeyboardKit Pro license includes.



## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks views in the ``KeyboardApp`` namespace, that let you quickly add keyboard-related features to your main app.

[Pro]: https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKitPro

@TabNavigator {
    
    @Tab("HomeScreen") {
        The ``KeyboardApp``.``KeyboardApp/HomeScreen`` can be used as the main home screen in a keyboard app. It can renders an app icon, keyboard statuses, settings links, and any  and a list of links and options that can be hidden, styled and localized to fit your needs. 
    
        ![KeyboardApp.HomeScreen](keyboardapp-homescreen)
    }
    
    @Tab("LocaleScreen") {
        The ``KeyboardApp``.``KeyboardApp/LocaleScreen`` can be used as the main language screen in your keyboard app. It renders a list of all added and available locales, and automatically syncs with the keyboard context's ``KeyboardContext/locale`` and ``KeyboardContext/addedLocales`` properties.
    
        ![KeyboardApp.SettingsScreen](keyboardapp-localescreen)
    }
    
    @Tab("SettingsScreen") {
        The ``KeyboardApp``.``KeyboardApp/SettingsScreen`` can be used as the main settings screen in your keyboard app. It renders a list of links and options, that can be hidden, styled and localized to fit your needs.
    
        ![KeyboardApp.SettingsScreen](keyboardapp-settingsscreen)
    }
}

Check out the type documentation in the KeyboardKit Pro documentation, or the demo app for some examples on how to use this view.

> Important: Note that for settings to sync between the main app and the keyboard extension, you must replace ``KeyboardSettings/store`` with an App Group-based store. You can use ``KeyboardSettings/setupStore(withAppGroup:keyPrefix:)`` to easily do this on app and keyboard launch.
