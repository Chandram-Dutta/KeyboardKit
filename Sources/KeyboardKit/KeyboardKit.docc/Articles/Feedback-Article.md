Feedback is an important part of the typing experience, where a keyboard can trigger audio and haptic feedback when a user taps on a key or performs certain actions.

In KeyboardKit, audio and haptic feedback can be triggered with a ``KeyboardActionHandler`` or by using the ``Feedback/Audio`` and ``Feedback/Haptic`` ``Feedback/Audio/trigger()`` functions directly.

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a convenient feedback toggle view, that lets you toggle between the last enabled feedback and a disabled configuration. Information about Pro features can be found at the end of this article.



## Feedback Namespace

KeyboardKit has a ``Feedback`` namespace with feedback-related types, like ``Feedback/Audio``, ``Feedback/Haptic``, etc.



## Feedback context

KeyboardKit has an observable ``FeedbackContext`` class that can be used to configure feedback for various actions, such as which configuration to use for audio and haptic feedback. 

KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of this class and injects it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/state``. You can use this instance to configure feedback



## Feedback settings

KeyboardKit has an observable ``FeedbackSettings`` that handles feedback-related settings, such as if audio and haptic feedback is enabled. This can be used to easily toggle haptic feedback on and off.

KeyboardKit's settings types are observable and will automatically persist any changes made. KeyboardKit will observe these types and sync any changes made to them to their respective contexts, which will automatically update the affected views.

KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of this class and injects it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/settings``. You can read more about how settings are handled in the <doc:Essentials> and <doc:Settings-Article> articles.



## Feedback Types

KeyboardKit has support for both audio and haptic feedback, which can both be triggered directly, or by using various types in the SDK, such as a ``KeyboardActionHandler``.


### Audio feedback

KeyboardKit has an ``Feedback/Audio`` feedback enum that defines various audio feedback types, like ``Feedback/Audio/input``, ``Feedback/Audio/system``, ``Feedback/Audio/delete``, etc. The ``Feedback`` namespace also has other audio-related types like ``Feedback/AudioConfiguration`` and ``Feedback/AudioEngine``.

### Haptic feedback

KeyboardKit has an ``Feedback/Haptic`` feedback enum that defines various haptic feedbacks, like ``Feedback/Haptic/success``, ``Feedback/Haptic/warning``, etc. The ``Feedback`` namespace also has other haptic-related types like ``Feedback/HapticConfiguration`` and ``Feedback/HapticEngine``.



## How to trigger feedback

You can trigger any ``Feedback/Audio`` and ``Feedback/Haptic`` feedback directly with their respective ``Feedback/Audio/trigger()`` functions:

```swift
Feedback.Audio.input.trigger()
Feedback.Haptic.success.trigger()
```

You can also trigger feedback with a ``KeyboardActionHandler``, using ``KeyboardActionHandler/triggerFeedback(for:on:)``. You can either use the feedback configuration described below to customize the feedback, or create a custom action handler. 



## How to configure feedback

You can use the ``FeedbackContext`` in ``KeyboardInputViewController/state`` to configure the global feedback behavior. For instance, this code would enable audio and haptic feedback, and customize the audio feedback for pressing an input key:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        let feedback = state.feedbackContext 
        feedback.audioConfiguration = .enabled
        feedback.audioConfiguration.input = .custom(id: 1329)
        feedback.hapticConfiguration = .enabled
    }
}
```

You can also use use the context or its underlying configurations to register custom feedback for any gesture on any action.

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        let feedback = state.feedbackContext
        feedback.registerCustomFeedback(.audio(.rocketFuse, for: .press, on: .rocket))
        feedback.registerCustomFeedback(.audio(.rocketLaunch, for: .release, on: .rocket))
        feedback.registerCustomFeedback(.haptic(.selection, for: .repeat, on: .rocket))
    }
}
```

Since the configuration is observable, any changes will automatically cause the keyboard to update, e.g. if you have feedback toggles.



## How to define custom audio feedback

Since ``Feedback/Audio`` uses **AudioServices** to play audio, you can use any system audio ID (see [this website](https://iphonedev.wiki/index.php/AudioServices) for info) as feedback. For instance, this is a way to define a custom sound, which can then be triggered with the ``Feedback/Audio/trigger()`` function:

```swift
extension Feedback.Audio {

    static let sentMessage = .custom(id: 1004)
}

Feedback.Audio.sentMessage.trigger()
```

You can also use the ``Feedback/Audio/customUrl(_:)`` enum case to define custom audio feedback that loads the sound effect from an audio file.

You can also implement a custom action handler to trigger feedback in a different ways. See the <doc:Actions-Article> article for more information.



## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a convenient feedback toggle that can be added to a keyboard toolbar to toggle audio or haptic feedback.

[Pro]: https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKitPro

### Views

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks views in the ``FeedbackConfiguration`` namespace, that let you easily toggle audio and haptic feedback:

@TabNavigator {
    
    @Tab("Toggle") {
        
        The feedback ``Feedback/Toggle`` can be used to toggle audio & haptic feedback on and off. It can be added to a toolbar, or anywhere you want it.
        
        ![FeedbackToggle](feedbackconfigurationtoggle)
        
        The view can be customized with other icons, and be further styled with native accent colors, fonts, etc. It's currently not style-based.
        
        Note that this toggle will use ``FeedbackContext/toggleIsAudioFeedbackEnabled()`` and ``FeedbackContext/toggleIsHapticFeedbackEnabled()``, which will toggle between a disabled configuration and the *last enabled* configuration. Haptic feedback uses a minimal configuration by default. 
    }
}
