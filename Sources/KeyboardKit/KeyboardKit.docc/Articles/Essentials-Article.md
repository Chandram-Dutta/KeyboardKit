KeyboardKit extends Apple's native keyboard APIs and provides you with a lot more functionality. It lets you mimic a native iOS keyboard and tweak its style and behavior, or create completely custom keyboards.

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardView`` view that mimics the native iOS keyboard. It can be customized and styled to great extent, and lets you replace any key content or key view of any action.

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a lot of essential Pro features. Information about Pro features can be found further down.

See the <doc:Getting-Started-Article> article for more information on how to use the controller to set up and customize your keyboard extension.

## Namespaces

KeyboardKit uses namespaces to make the API surface smaller, by nesting types in logical groups. KeyboardKit has namespaces like ``Keyboard``, ``KeyboardAction`` ``KeyboardLayout``, ``Callouts``, ``Dictation``, ``Feedback``, etc.

Namespaces will not contain protocols, nor important types that are meant to be exposed as top-level types. This includes essential types like ``KeyboardInputViewController``, ``KeyboardContext``, etc., and important view components like ``KeyboardView``.

The ``Keyboard`` namespace contains a lot of essential, keyboard-related types and views. By typing ``Keyboard`` and `.`, Xcode will list all essential types within this namespace.

The namespace has a lot of essential types, like ``Keyboard/KeyboardType``, ``Keyboard/KeyboardCase``, ``Keyboard/AutocapitalizationType``, ``Keyboard/ReturnKeyType``, ``Keyboard/Diacritic``, ``Keyboard/Gesture``, etc. and view-related types, like ``Keyboard/Button``, ``Keyboard/ButtonStyle``, ``Keyboard/Toolbar``, etc.



## Controller

``KeyboardInputViewController`` is the most essential type in the library. Just make your **KeyboardController** inherit this class to get access to a bunch of additional ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``, ``KeyboardInputViewController/state``, and view lifecycle functions like ``KeyboardInputViewController/viewWillSetupKeyboardView()``.

You can override many of the controller's open functions to customize its behavior. By delegating the responsibility of certain operations to its ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` and ``KeyboardInputViewController/state``, you can avoid having to rely on the controller for most operations. 

KeyboardKit also has a ``KeyboardController`` protocol that aims to make it easier to use KeyboardKit in other platforms than UIKit.



## Context

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardContext`` that provides observable keyboard state that keeps the keyboard UI up to date. It has a ``KeyboardContext/textDocumentProxy`` reference, lets you get and set the ``KeyboardContext/locale``, ``KeyboardContext/keyboardType``, etc. It also has auto-persisted ``KeyboardContext/settings-swift.property``. 

Other namespaces define other context types, like ``AutocompleteContext``, ``CalloutContext``, ``DictationContext``, etc. They will all automatically update the keyboard view when they're observed, and provide namespace-specific settings.

KeyboardKit automatically creates instances of these classes and injects them into ``KeyboardInputViewController/state``, and syncs with the controller when needed.



## Settings

KeyboardKit has a ``Keyboard/Settings`` class that has a global ``Keyboard/Settings/store`` that is used to persist all context settings. If you set up KeyboardKit with a ``KeyboardApp`` that defines an App Group, this store is set up to sync data between the app and its keyboard.

> Important: `@AppStorage` properties use the store that's available when they're first accessed. Make sure to set up a custom store BEFORE accessing any of these settings properties.



## Behavior

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardBehavior`` protocol that can be used to define the keyboard's behavior. It's used by some services, like the standard ``KeyboardActionHandler``, to make behavior-based decisions.

KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of ``Keyboard/StandardBehavior`` and injects it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``. You can replace it at any time, by implementing the procotol from scratch or by inheriting and customizing the standard behavior.



## Extensions

KeyboardKit extends native types like ``UIKit/UITextDocumentProxy`` with keyboard-specific functionality. See the extension section in documentation root article for more info.



## Keyboard View

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardView`` that mimics a native iOS keyboard. It can be used for alphabetic, numeric & symbolic keyboards, supports all supported locales, layouts, callouts, etc., and can be styled to great extent with styles & themes:

@Row {
    
    @Column {
        ![KeyboardView](keyboardview-english)
    }
    
    @Column {
        ![KeyboardView](keyboardview-swedish)
    }
    
    @Column {
        ![KeyboardView](keyboardview-styled)
    }
}

The view can be customized to great extent. You can pass in custom services & state, and replace any button or entire sub-component:

```swift
KeyboardView(
    controller: controller,             // You can pass in a controller, or specific states and services
    buttonContent: { $0.view },         // You can customize the content view of any button
    buttonView: { $0.view },            // You can customize the entire view of any button
    emojiKeyboard: { $0.view },         // You can customize the emoji keyboard, if any
    toolbar: { params in params.view }  // You can customize the toolbar above the keyboard
)
```

Note that some content types, like the emoji keyboard and the collapsed content, requires KeyboardKit Pro to be handled automatically. Without KeyboardKit Pro, you must manually implement what to show and when to show it.

Just return `{ $0.view }` or `{ params in params.view }` to use the standard view, or return a custom view for any part of the keyboard. Each view builder provides you with view-related parameters with contextual information.


## Views

The ``Keyboard`` namespace has a lot of other standard views, styles, and view-related types to make it easy to build great keyboards.

@TabNavigator {
    
    @Tab("Button") {
        @Row {
            @Column {
                ![Keyboard Button](keyboard-buttonpreview)
            }
            @Column {
                The ``Keyboard`` namespace has a collection of ``Keyboard/Button`` views & styles that can be used to mimic all parts of a native keyboard.
                
                A ``Keyboard/Button`` renders the full button, while other views like ``Keyboard/ButtonShadow`` (not shown here) renders parts of it.
            }
        }
    }
    
    @Tab("BottomRow") {
        ![Bottom Row](keyboard-bottomrow)
        
        The keyboard ``Keyboard/BottomRow`` renders a bottom keyboard row with the same behavior as a full ``KeyboardView``. It can be used when you want to replace the rows above with a custom user interface.
    }
    
    @Tab("CollapsedView") {
        @Row {
            @Column {
                ![Collapsed View](keyboard-collapsedview)
            }
            @Column {
                The ``Keyboard/CollapsedView`` can be used to render a collapsed view when the ``KeyboardContext/isKeyboardCollapsed`` is true.
                
                KeyboardKit Pro automatically detects when an external keyboard is connected or disconnected, and update the state accordingly.
                
                The ``KeyboardView`` has a `collapsedContent` view builder that lets you specify which view to use as collapsed content.
            }
        }
    }
    
    @Tab("Keyboard Switcher") {
        @Row {
            @Column {
                ![NextKeyboardButton](keyboard-nextkeyboardbutton)
            }
            @Column {
                The ``Keyboard/NextKeyboardButton`` can be used to switch to the next keyboard on tap and to show a keyboard menu on long press.
            }
        }
    }
    
    @Tab("NumberPad") {
        @Row {
            @Column {
                ![NextKeyboardButton](keyboard-numberpad)
            }
            @Column {
                The ``Keyboard/NumberPad`` mimics a native number pad. ``KeyboardView`` will automatically show it for the ``Keyboard/KeyboardType/numberPad`` keyboard type.
            }
        }
    }
    
    @Tab("Toolbar") {
        ![Keyboard Toolbar](keyboardtoolbar)
        
        The keyboard  ``Keyboard/Toolbar`` applies a minimum height to its content. KeyboardKit always adds a toolbar to the ``KeyboardView`` by default, to avoid callouts from being cut off, since a custom keyboard can't render any content outside of its frame.
    }
}

---

Most KeyboardKit views have a corresponding style & style modifier that can be applied to an individual view or an entire view hierarchy. You can e.g. apply a ``SwiftUICore/View/autocompleteToolbarStyle(_:)`` to the ``KeyboardView`` to customize the callout style within the view.

The ``KeyboardView`` however requires a ``KeyboardStyleService`` to style its buttons, since this requires dynamic styling on a per-button basis. You can however apply styles to the views you return in the ``KeyboardView``'s `buttonView` view builder.
    
See the <doc:Styling-Article> article for more information.

## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks additional, powerful ``KeyboardView`` capabilities, including full support for all ``Foundation/Locale/keyboardKitSupported`` locales, a full-blown ``EmojiKeyboard``, input toolbars, powerful ``KeyboardViewPreview``s, etc.

[Pro]: https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKitPro


### Views

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks additional ``Keyboard``-related views and utilities, that make it easier to create even more powerful keyboards:

@TabNavigator {
    
    @Tab("Localization") {
        @Row {
            @Column {
                ![KeyboardView in Swedish](keyboardview-swedish)
            }
            @Column {
                KeyboardKit Pro unlocks localized services for all ``Foundation/Locale/keyboardKitSupported`` locales. This lets you create fully localized keyboards that automatically use correct buttons, autocomplete & callouts.
                
                The various license tiers unlock different amount of locales, where Gold unlocks all. See the <doc:Localization-Article> article for more information.
            }
        }
        
    }
    
    @Tab("Emoji Keyboard") {
        @Row {
            @Column { 
                ![Emoji Keyboard](emojikeyboard)
            }
            @Column { 
                KeyboardKit Pro unlocks an ``EmojiKeyboard`` that is added to ``KeyboardView`` when a valid license is registered.
                
                The emoji keyboard has support for categories, runtime version adjustments and skintones. Read more in the <doc:Emojis-Article> article.        
            }
        }
        
    }
    
    @Tab("Input Toolbar") {
        @Row {
            @Column { 
                ![Input Row in iPad](inputtoolbar-ipad)
            }
            @Column { 
                KeyboardKit Pro will automatically add an additional input toolbar above ``KeyboardView`` on large iPads, to fit the native keyboard.
                
                You can apply ``SwiftUICore/View/keyboardInputToolbarDisplayMode(_:)`` to the keyboard view to set whether to show or hide the toolbar, or to customize its buttons.
            }
        }
    }
    
    @Tab("Toggle Toolbar") {
        
        ![ToggleToolbar](keyboardtoggletoolbar)
        
        The ``Keyboard/ToggleToolbar`` can be used to toggle between two toolbars, e.g. to place a main menu "behind" the autocomplete toolbar.
        
        This view wraps itself in a ``Keyboard/Toolbar``, which means that it can also be styled with the ``SwiftUICore/View/keyboardToolbarStyle(_:)`` modifier.
    }
}


### Previews

KeyboardKit Pro also unlocks ``Keyboard``-related previews, that can be used to preview ``KeyboardView`` and ``Keyboard``.``Keyboard/Button`` for various configurations, locales, styles, themes, etc.

@TabNavigator {
    
    @Tab("KeyboardViewPreview") {
        KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a ``KeyboardViewPreview`` that can preview the ``KeyboardView`` for various locales, styles, themes, etc.

        @Row {
            @Column {
                ![KeyboardView Preview - Swedish](keyboardview-swedish)
            }
            @Column {
                ![KeyboardView Preview - Turkish](keyboardviewpreview)
            }
            @Column {
                ![KeyboardView Preview - Theme](keyboardviewpreview-theme)
            }
        }
    }
    
    @Tab("ButtonPreview") {
        @Row {
            @Column { 
                ![Keyboard Button Preview](keyboard-buttonpreview)
            }
            @Column { 
                KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a ``Keyboard/ButtonPreview`` that can be used to preview a ``Keyboard``.``Keyboard/Button``.
                
                This view is a lot more performant than the full ``KeyboardViewPreview``. Consider using it when you list multiple themes.
            }
        }
    }
}

These previews can be used in the main application, to show users how the keyboard will look for different settings, styles, themes, etc.

See the <doc:Previews-Article> article for more information.
