Autocomplete is an important part of the typing experience, where word suggestions can be presented in a toolbar above the keyboard as the user types, and incorrectly text can be autocorrected.

In KeyboardKit, an ``AutocompleteService`` can provide suggestions and predictions to the main ``AutocompleteContext``. Unlike other services, there's no standard service implementation in the open-source SDK.

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks an on-device ``Autocomplete/LocalService`` and a ``Autocomplete/RemoteService`` for integration with remote APIs, as well as next character predictions and AI-powered next word prediction. Information about Pro features can be found further down.

## Namespace

KeyboardKit has an ``Autocomplete`` namespace that contains autocomplete-related types and views, like a ``Autocomplete/Suggestion`` model, a ``Autocomplete/Toolbar`` component, etc.



## Context

KeyboardKit has an ``AutocompleteContext`` that provides observable autocomplete state that is kept up to date as the user types. It also has auto-persisted ``AutocompleteContext/settings-swift.property`` that can be used to customize the autocomplete behavior, toggle features, etc.

KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of this class, injects it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/state`` and updates it whenever autocomplete is performed.



## Services

In KeyboardKit, an ``AutocompleteService`` can provide suggestions when the user types or the text input cursor moves in the text.

KeyboardKit doesn't have a standard autocomplete service. Instead, it injects a ``AutocompleteService/disabled`` service into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` until you register [KeyboardKit Pro][pro] or inject your own service implementation. Read more further down.



## Views

The ``Autocomplete`` namespace has autocomplete-specific views, that can be used to mimic native autocomplete toolbars and items.

@TabNavigator {
    
    @Tab("Toolbar") {
        @Row {
            @Column {
                ![AutocompleteToolbar](autocompletetoolbar)
            }
            @Column {
                The autocomplete ``Autocomplete/Toolbar`` can be used to show autocomplete suggestions as the user types.
         
                The view can be styled with a ``Autocomplete/ToolbarStyle``, which is applied with the ``SwiftUICore/View/autocompleteToolbarStyle(_:)`` view modifier. You can also use completely custom views.
                
                This view is used as the standard toolbar by the ``KeyboardView``. This means that you can style it with a global style modifier.
            }
        }
    }
}

## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a ``Autocomplete/LocalService`` and ``Autocomplete/RemoteService`` and injects a ``Autocomplete/LocalService`` into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` when you register a valid license. These services are open to inheritance, so you can inherit and customize them to fit your needs.


### Local Autocomplete

The ``Autocomplete/LocalService`` performs autocomplete operations locally, on-device. It supporst many keyboard locales, works offline, doesn't require Full Access and can integrate with system services, like the local lexicon.

The service supports: **arabic, bulgarian, czech, danish, dutch, dutch_belgium, english, english_gb, english_us, filipino, finnish, french, french_belgium, french_switzerland, german, german_austria, german_switzerland, greek, hebrew, hungarian, irish, italian, norwegian, polish, portuguese_brazil, portuguese, romanian, russian, spanish, swedish, turkish, ukrainian**.

You can inject a custom ``Autocomplete/NextWordPredictionRequest`` into the service to make it perform next word predictions, using external AI-based services. See the next word prediction section further down.


### Remote Autocomplete

The ``Autocomplete/RemoteService`` can be used to perform autocomplete by integrating with an external API. It requires that the device is online, and requires that Full Access is enabled, to allow the keyboard to make network requests.

You create a custom remote autocomplete service by defining which URL to call, any potential headers or query parameters, as well as a result type that can parse the remote request response. 


### Next Character Prediction

The ``Autocomplete/LocalService`` and ``Autocomplete/RemoteService`` will automatically perform next-character predictions based on the result. The result can be used by ``KeyboardView`` to increase the tap area of more probable keys, to reduce the risk of incorrect key taps.

You can disable next-character predictions with the ``AutocompleteContext`` ``AutocompleteContext/Settings-swift.struct/isNextCharacterPredictionEnabled`` setting.


### Next Word Prediction (BETA)

Apple's on-device text prediction utilities stopped supporting next word prediction in iOS 16, and can now only complete already started words. KeyboardKit Pro therefore unlocks ways to let ``Autocomplete/LocalService`` perform next word prediction via 3rd party AI tools.

The easiest way to make the ``Autocomplete/LocalService`` perform next word prediction, is to specify a ``Autocomplete/NextWordPredictionRequest`` in your ``KeyboardApp``'s ``KeyboardApp/autocompleteConfiguration-swift.property``. This will inject it into the autocomplete service when your license is registered:

```swift
extension KeyboardApp {

    static var keyboardKitDemo: Self {
        .init(
            ...
            autocompleteConfiguration: .init(
                nextWordPredictionRequest: .claude(apiKey: ...)
            )
        )
    }
}
```

You must also explicitly enable the ``AutocompleteContext``'s ``AutocompleteContext/Settings-swift.struct/isNextWordPredictionEnabled`` setting to enable this feature.

> Important: AI-based next word prediction requires Full Access for network access. The feature is disabled by default, to avoid sending user text to 3rd party services without user consent. Make sure to explicitly get the user's consent before activating this feature!

KeyboardKit Pro currently only provides a ``Autocomplete/NextWordPredictionRequest/claude(apiKey:apiVersion:apiUrl:model:maxTokens:system:)`` request. More 3rd party request types will be added in the future. All requests require that you use your own API keys.

## How to...


### Perform autocomplete

The ``KeyboardInputViewController`` will automatically call ``KeyboardController/performAutocomplete()`` whenever the keyboard text changes, then update the ``Keyboard/State/autocompleteContext`` with the result from the ``Keyboard/Services/autocompleteService``.

You can configure the ``Keyboard/State/autocompleteContext`` and override ``KeyboardInputViewController``'s autocomplete properties and functions to customize the keyboard's autocomplete behavior.

The ``KeyboardView`` will automatically add an ``Autocomplete``.``Autocomplete/Toolbar`` that lists the autocomplete context ``AutocompleteContext/suggestions`` and also gives the keyboard some additional top space for callouts to render without being clipped.



### Create a custom autocomplete service

You can create a custom autocomplete service to customize the autocomplete behavior or integrate with 3rd party services. You can implement ``AutocompleteService`` from scratch, or inherit and customize any of the [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] services:

```swift
class CustomAutocompleteService: AutocompleteService {

    init(match: String = "match") {
        self.match = match
    }

    private var match: String
    
    var locale: Locale = .current
    
    var canIgnoreWords: Bool { false }
    var canLearnWords: Bool { false }
    var ignoredWords: [String] = []
    var learnedWords: [String] = []
    
    func hasIgnoredWord(_ word: String) -> Bool { false }
    func hasLearnedWord(_ word: String) -> Bool { false }
    func ignoreWord(_ word: String) {}
    func learnWord(_ word: String) {}
    func removeIgnoredWord(_ word: String) {}
    func unlearnWord(_ word: String) {}
    
    func autocompleteSuggestions(
        for text: String
    ) async throws -> [Autocomplete.Suggestion] {
        guard text.count > 0 else { return [] }
        let currentWord = text.wordFragmentAtEnd
        if currentWord == match {
            return matchSuggestions()
        } else {
            return fakeSuggestions(for: text)
        }
    }
}

private extension CustomAutocompleteService {
    
    func fakeSuggestions(for text: String) -> [Autocomplete.Suggestion] {
        [
            .init(text: text, isUnknown: true),
            .init(text: text, isAutocorrect: true),
            .init(text: text, subtitle: "Subtitle")
        ]
    }
    
    func fakeSuggestion(_ text: String, _ subtitle: String? = nil) -> Autocomplete.Suggestion {
        .init(text: text, subtitle: subtitle)
    }

    func matchSuggestions() -> [Autocomplete.Suggestion] {
        [
            .init(text: match, isUnknown: true),
            .init(text: match, isAutocorrect: true),
            .init(text: match),
        ]
    }
}
```

To use this service instead of the standard one, just inject it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` by replacing its ``Keyboard/Services/autocompleteService`` property:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        services.autocompleteService = CustomAutocompleteService()
        setup(for: .myApp)  // See the getting-started guide
    }
}
```

This will make KeyboardKit use your custom autocomplete service instead of the standard one.
