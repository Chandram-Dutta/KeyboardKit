Dictation can be used to let users enter text by speaking instead of typing on the keyboard. Since keyboard extensions have no access to the microphone, KeyboardKit lets you trigger dictation from a keyboard extension and perform it in the main app.

In KeyboardKit, a ``DictationService`` can start dictation from the keyboard by opening the main app, perform dictation in the app, then return to the keyboard and apply the dictated text when dictation completes.

Unlike most other service types, the open-source project doesn't include a dictation service. You have to upgrade to KeyboardKit Pro or implement a custom dictation service to be able to use dictation in your keyboard.

üëë [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a ``Dictation/StandardDictationService`` that can be used to perform dictation from the keyboard. Information about Pro features can be found further down.



## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Requirements!

Since keyboard dictation is based on navigating between the keyboard and the main app, and to share information between the two, a keyboard that wishes yo use dictation must use an App Group and set up the app and keyboard to use it.

See the <doc:Getting-Started-Article> and <doc:Essentials-Article> articles for information on how to properly set up your app and keyboard to share data storage. 



## Namespace

KeyboardKit has a ``Dictation`` namespace that contains dictation-related types, like ``Dictation/AuthorizationStatus``, as well as views that are unlocked by KeyboardKit Pro, like ``Dictation/Screen`` & ``Dictation/BarVisualizer``. 



## Context

KeyboardKit has a ``DictationContext`` that has observable dictation state, as well as auto-persisted ``DictationContext/settings-swift.property`` that can be used to configure the dictation behavior.

KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of this class, injects it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/state`` and updates it whenever dictation is performed.



## Services

In KeyboardKit, a ``DictationService`` can start autocomplete from a keyboard by opening the main app and let it perform dictation, then return to the keyboard and apply the dictated text.

Unlike most other service types, the open-source project doesn't include a dictation service. Instead, it injects a ``DictationService/disabled`` dictation service into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` until you register [KeyboardKit Pro][pro] or inject your own service implementation.



## Settings

KeyboardKit has a ``Dictation``-specific ``Dictation/Settings`` type with auto-persisted settings. The ``DictationContext`` ``DictationContext/settings-swift.property`` is used by default within KeyboardKit.



## Speech Recognizer

The ``Dictation/StandardDictationService`` requires that you provide a ``DictationSpeechRecognizer`` implementation. You can copy the source code for a standard recognizer below.

The standard dictation speech recognizer supports the following locales: 

Arabic (ar-SA), Cantonese (yue-CN), Catalan (ca-ES), Chinese (zh-CN), Chinese (zh-HK), Chinese (zh-TW), Croatian (hr-HR), Czech (cs-CZ), Danish (da-DK), Dutch (nl-BE), Dutch (nl-NL), English (en-AE), English (en-AU), English (en-CA), English (en-GB), English (en-ID), English (en-IE), English (en-IN), English (en-NZ), English (en-PH), English (en-SA), English (en-SG), English (en-US), English (en-ZA), Finnish (fi-FI), French (fr-BE), French (fr-CA), French (fr-CH), French (fr-FR), German (de-AT), German (de-CH), German (de-DE), Greek (el-GR), Hebrew (he-IL), Hindi (hi-IN), Hindi (hi-IN-translit), Hindi (hi-Latn), Hungarian (hu-HU), Indonesian (id-ID), Italian (it-CH), Italian (it-IT), Japanese (ja-JP), Korean (ko-KR), Malay (ms-MY), Norwegian Bokm√•l (nb-NO), Polish (pl-PL), Portuguese (pt-BR), Portuguese (pt-PT), Romanian (ro-RO), Russian (ru-RU), Shanghainese (wuu-CN), Slovak (sk-SK), Spanish (es-419), Spanish (es-CL), Spanish (es-CO), Spanish (es-ES), Spanish (es-MX), Spanish (es-US), Swedish (sv-SE), Thai (th-TH), Turkish (tr-TR), Ukrainian (uk-UA), Vietnamese (vi-VN)

The reason why the standard speech recognizer isn't part of the SDK, is that it requires the **Speech** framework, which would require all apps that use KeyboardKit to add certain permission information to the Info.plist, even if they don't use dictation.



## Standard Dictation Behavior

When you start dictation from the keyboard, the keyboard will by default open the main app and perform dictation there, after which it will try to return to the keyboard. The reason for this is that the keyboard doesn't have access to the microphone.

Due to Apple's major restrictions on how apps can interact with eachother, the main app will only be able to return to the keyboard if it was used in an app that KeyboardKit knows how to open. 

KeyboardKit will use its ``KeyboardHostApplication`` capabilities to try to identify the app, and redirect to it using a deep link that will open the app. If this is successful, the keyboard read the persisted dictation result and send the text to the host app.

See the <doc:Host-Article> for more information on which apps that are currently supported, and how to add more apps to this database.

## üëë KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks services that let you setup and perform dictation in your app and from your keyboard, with very little code.

[Pro]: https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKitPro


### Services

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a ``Dictation/StandardDictationService`` that can be used to start dictation from a keyboard extension, by opening the main app and perform dictation there, then return to the keyboard (if possible).


### Views

KeyboardKit Pro adds dictation-related views to the ``Dictation`` namespace, to let you quickly add dictation visualization to your app:

@TabNavigator {
    
    @Tab("Screen") {
        
        @Row {
            @Column {
                ![DictationScreen](dictationscreen)
            }
            @Column {
                KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a ``Dictation``.``Dictation/Screen`` that overlays your app with a dictation view when dictation is active.
                
                This view can be styled with a ``Dictation/ScreenStyle``, which can be applied with a ``SwiftUICore/View/dictationScreenStyle(_:)`` modifier.
            }
        }
    }
    
    @Tab("BarVisualizer") {
        
        @Row {
            @Column {
                ![DictationScreen](dictationscreen)
            }
            @Column {
                KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a ``Dictation/BarVisualizer`` that renders a set of animated bars. You can change the number of bars, colors, etc.
                
                This view can be styled with a ``Dictation/BarVisualizerStyle``, which can be applied with a ``SwiftUICore/View/dictationScreenStyle(_:)`` modifier.
            }
        }
    }
}

## How to...


### ...perform dictation

Dictation works differently in apps, where microphone access is available, and in keyboard extensions, where mic access is unavailable. You can use a ``DictationService`` to perform dictation from both a keyboard extension, as well as in the main app.

Before your app can perform dictation, you must configure your app to require the correct permissions. This is described further down.

To make your keyboard extension start dictation, just trigger ``DictationService/startDictationFromKeyboard()`` or a ``KeyboardAction/dictation`` action. This will open the main app, perform dictation, then (try to) return to the keyboard once it's is done.

To make an app perform dictation that is started by the keyboard, just apply a `.keyboardDictation` modifier to the root view. You can also call ``DictationService/startDictationInApp()`` to perform dictation directly within the app.

iOS 17 caused keyboard back navigation to stop working. KeyboardKit Pro uses a list of known ``KeyboardHostApplication``s to fix this, but you can override ``DictationService/returnToKeyboardFromApp()`` to customize it, and use ``DictationContext/returnToKeyboardFromAppError`` to see why back navigation failed.

The user can always tap the top-leading back button to return to the keyboard from the app. Your app should point to this arrow if the back navigation doesn't work.



### ...configure your app to handle dictation

This section describes how to set up an app to start dictation from its keyboard extension and perform the dictation in the main app.


#### Step 1 - Set up the required permissions

Before you can start dictation, you must add these keys to your app's `Info.plist`, otherwise the app will crash at runtime:

```
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Describe why you need microphone access.</string>
<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>Describe why you need speech recognition.</string>
```


#### Step 2 - Create an App Group

To share data between your app and keyboard extension, you must setup a shared app group for both targets:

@Row {
    @Column {
        ![Set up an App Group for the app](dictation-appgroup-app)        
    }
    @Column {
        ![Set up an App Group for the keyboard](dictation-appgroup-keyboard)       
    }
}

Add this App Group ID to your ``KeyboardApp``'s ``KeyboardApp/appGroupId`` property, to properly set up dictation for the keyboard and its main app.


#### Step 3 - Create a deep link

To make it possible for the keyboard to open the app, you must set up a deep link URL scheme for the app target:

![Set up a URL Scheme for the app](dictation-url-scheme)

Add this deep link to your ``KeyboardApp``'s ``KeyboardApp/deepLinks-swift.property`` property, to properly set up deep linking for the keyboard and its main app.


#### Step 4 - Create a speech recognizer

KeyboardKit uses a ``DictationSpeechRecognizer`` protocol to decouple KeyboardKit from the Speech framework, to avoid having to specify dictation permissions in apps that don't use speech recognition.

Here's a standard speech recognizer implementation that you can add to your app and inject into the keyboard dictation view modifier:

```swift
import KeyboardKitPro
import Speech

public extension DictationSpeechRecognizer where Self == StandardSpeechRecognizer {

    static var standard: Self { .init() }
} 

public class StandardSpeechRecognizer: DictationSpeechRecognizer {

    public init() {}

    private var recognizer: SFSpeechRecognizer?
    private var request: SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest?
    private var speechRecognizerTask: SFSpeechRecognitionTask?

    private typealias Err = Dictation.ServiceError

    public var authorizationStatus: Dictation.AuthorizationStatus {
        SFSpeechRecognizer.authorizationStatus().keyboardDictationStatus
    }

    public var supportedLocales: [Locale] {
        Array(SFSpeechRecognizer.supportedLocales())
    }

    public func requestDictationAuthorization() async throws -> Dictation.AuthorizationStatus {
        await withCheckedContinuation { continuation in
            SFSpeechRecognizer.requestAuthorization { status in
                continuation.resume(returning: status.keyboardDictationStatus)
            }
        }
    }

    public func resetDictationResult() async throws {}

    public func startDictation(
        with locale: Locale
    ) async throws {
        try await startDictation(
            with: locale,
            resultHandler: nil
        )
    }

    public func startDictation(
        with locale: Locale,
        resultHandler: ((Dictation.SpeechRecognizerResult) -> Void)?
    ) async throws {
        recognizer = SFSpeechRecognizer(locale: locale)
        guard let recognizer else { throw Err.missingSpeechRecognizer }
        request = SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest()
        request?.shouldReportPartialResults = true
        guard let request else { throw Err.missingSpeechRecognitionRequest }
        speechRecognizerTask = recognizer.recognitionTask(with: request) {
            let result = Dictation.SpeechRecognizerResult(
                dictatedText: $0?.bestTranscription.formattedString,
                error: $1,
                isFinal: $0?.isFinal ?? true)
            resultHandler?(result)
        }
    }

    public func stopDictation() async throws {
        request?.endAudio()
        request = nil
        speechRecognizerTask?.cancel()
        speechRecognizerTask = nil
    }

    public func setupAudioEngineBuffer(_ buffer: AVAudioPCMBuffer) {
        request?.append(buffer)
    }
}
```


#### Step 5 - Set up dictation in your keyboard extension

To set up dictation for your keyboard extension, just setup your app and keyboard as described in the <doc:Getting-Started-Article> article, using a ``KeyboardApp`` that defines a ``KeyboardApp/DeepLinks-swift.struct/dictation`` deep link, or at least an ``KeyboardApp/DeepLinks-swift.struct/app`` deep link to use the standard dictation link pattern.


#### Step 6 - Set up dictation in your main application

To set up dictation for your main app, just wrap its root view in a  ``KeyboardAppView``, as described in the <doc:Getting-Started-Article> article, then apply any of the available `keyboardDictation` view modifiers to make the app trigger dictation:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {

    @Environment(\.openURL)
    var openURL
    
    @EnvironmentObject
    private var dictationContext: DictationContext

    @EnvironmentObject
    private var keyboardContext: KeyboardContext

    var body: some View {
        KeyboardAppView(for: .keyboardKitDemo) {
            ...
        }
        .keyboardDictation(
            dictationContext: dictationContext,
            keyboardContext: keyboardContext,
            openUrl: openURL,
            speechRecognizer: .standard,         // As defined earlier
            overlay: dictationOverlay            // You can use any view
        )
    }

    func overlay() -> some View {
        Dictation.Screen(
            dictationContext: context,
            titleView: { EmptyView() },
            indicator: { Dictation.BarVisualizer(isAnimating: $0) }
        )
    } 
}
```

The keyboard dictation view modifier has an overlay parameter that defines the view to show while dictation is active. You can use the Pro dictation ``Dictation/Screen`` with any of the built-in dictation visualizers, or a completely custom view.

#### Step 7 - Perform dictation

You can now start dictation in your keyboard by triggering a ``KeyboardAction/dictation`` action or by calling ``DictationService/startDictationFromKeyboard()``. 

If everything is correctly configured, the keyboard extension should open its main app to start dictation. Once dictation is done, the app should return to the keyboard to handle the dictated text, as long as the host application is known (as described above).

You can override ``KeyboardInputViewController/viewWillHandleDictationResult()`` to customize how the keyboard controller handles the dictation result. If not, the keyboard will automatically send the dictated text to the host application.
