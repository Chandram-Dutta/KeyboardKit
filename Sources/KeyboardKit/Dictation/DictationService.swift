/// This protocol can be implemented by any classes that can
/// perform dictation from a keyboard extension or in an app.
///
/// Since keyboard extensions can't access the microphone, a
/// dictation service must open the main app to let it start
/// dictation, write the dictation results to a shared state,
/// then navigate back to the keyboard and handle the result.
///
/// KeyboardKit doesn't have a standard dictation service as
/// it has for other services. Instead, a disabled dictation
/// service will be used until you setup KeyboardKit Pro, or
/// register a custom service.
