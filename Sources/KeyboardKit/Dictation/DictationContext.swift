/// This class has observable states and persistent settings,
/// as well as a couple of persisted properties that are not
/// considered settings, but carry state between the app and
/// its keyboard extension.
///
/// The context is used by both ``DictationService`` as well
/// as ``KeyboardDictationService``. Use an initializer that
/// fits your needs, as described in <doc:Dictation-Article>.
///
/// The ``dictatedText`` property is updated while dictation
/// is performed, together with many other properties, which
/// are used by the dictation services.
///
/// The ``silenceLimit`` settings can be used to control how
/// long time a user can be silent before the dictation will
/// automatically wrap up.
///
/// The ``lastError`` can be set by a dictation service when
/// something goes wrong. You can observe this to handle any
/// errors for the user.
///
/// The ``returnToKeyboardFromAppError`` should be set if an
/// app can't navigate back to the keyboard. You can observe
/// it to add an arrow that points to the top-leading system
/// back button if this becomes `true`.
///
/// KeyboardKit will automatically setup an instance of this
/// class in ``KeyboardInputViewController/state``, then use
/// it as global state and inject it as an environment value.
///
/// > Important: KeyboardKit 9.0 will remove the manual data
/// persistency and replace it with @AppStorage.
