/// your app, and is also a namespace for app-based features.
///
/// You can create a static app value and add it to both the
/// app and its keyboard, to be able to use it in both, e.g.:
///
/// ```swift
/// extension KeyboardApp {
///     static var keyboardKitDemo: Self {
///         .init(
///             name: "KeyboardKit",
///             licenseKey: "abc123",
///             appGroupId: "group.com.keyboardkit.demo",
///             locales: [.english, .swedish, .persian],
///             autocomplete: .init(...),
///             deepLinks: .init(app: "keyboardkit://")
///         )
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// > Important: The ``locales`` specifies which locales you
/// want to enable for the app. You don't have to provide it
/// if you have a KeyboardKit Pro Gold license, since it has
/// all locales enabled. The list is otherwise capped to the
/// amount of locales that your license includes.
