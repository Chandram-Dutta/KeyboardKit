    /// emoji added firstmost, while ``frequent`` should use
    /// a more sophisticated algorithm and take frequency in
    /// consideration when updating the category.

    /// Since EmojiKit does not have algoritms for frequency

    /// changes to both ``recent`` and ``frequent``. You can
    /// however use the ``frequent`` category if you want to
    /// implement your own frequency logic.
